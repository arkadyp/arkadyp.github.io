In process of refactor. Post will be back up tonight.


<!-- Quick intro:


CoffeScript
'BLOCK QUOTE' (http://coffeescript.org/)
'The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.'  
  
Set up basic file structure:  
.  
├── javascript  
|   ├── file1.js  
|   └── file2.js  
├── coffee  
|   ├── file1.coffee  
|   └── file2.coffee  
├── lib  
|   ├── underbar  
|   └── backbone  
├── node_modules  
    └─- ....  
└── index.html  


Import coffee-script into the project via the node_module folder using
1.) 'npm install coffee-script'
2.) coffee --compile --output js --watch coffee
